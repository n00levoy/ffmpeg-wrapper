# FFmpeg Wrapper
Minimalistic ffmpeg wrapper for frame size / video bitrate / subtitles managing

This app is just simple GUI wrapper around FFmpeg executables and lets you have no worries about writing long CLI commands for performing such tasks as:
* Changing frame size and bitrate for video stream (using libx264 encoding)
* Managing embedded subtitles (adding new UTF-encoded SRT streams and deleting existing ones)
